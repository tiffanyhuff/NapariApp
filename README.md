Description:
-----------------------

This application will allow a user to utilize the multi-dimensional viewer and image analysis platform [napari](https://napari.org/stable/#) on the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) [Lonestar6 Supercomputer](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/lonestar6).

Running the Application:
-----------------------
To run the application, the user must submit a job using the [3D Electron Microscopy (3Dem)](https://3dem.org/) web-based research platform. Once running, a virtual DCV session will be initialized for the user, and a button on the History/Jobs page will appear allowing the user to open the session. Additionally, a document titled 'napari_dcvserver.txt' will be created in the user's work folder with connection instructions. Once connected, the napari software will begin running.

For instructions on using napari, please see the [documentation](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/getting_started.html#getting-started-with-napari). Additional information can be found on the napari [github](https://github.com/napari/napari#napari).
